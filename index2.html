                                        Amanda has a BA in English and Art, an MA in Theater 
                                        and Performance Studies, and currently works in a pharmacy 
                                        so, naturally, she thought learning full-stack development would be the next logical 
                                        step. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Honestly though, she knows design, creativity, and 
                                        how to finish a project. She can think on her feet 
                                        and likes building on the works of others both collaboratively 
                                        and individually. She thinks most of these skills are 
                                        transferable to coding, and she hopes to build more skills 
                                        along the way.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In her spare time, Amanda likes knitting, painting, playing
                                        with dogs, and boxing. She likes to work with her hands
                                        and to read long novels. Unsuprisingly, Herman Melville's 
                                        Moby-Dick is her favourite book. Her top five favourite 
                                        bands are Stars, New Order, The Decemberists, David Bowie, 
                                        and Fleet Foxes. Her top five favourite foods are tacos, 
                                        pizza, cannoli, bread, and tacos (at the moment, y'all, 
                                        because she really loves food of all kinds). Sometimes she uses 
                                        British spellings because she lived in England for two 
                                        years. One day she wants to have a house and a wife and 
                                        a yard so she can actually garden.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Amanda thinks she will be most interested in Front End 
                                        Development, but she is very intrigued by the mysteries
                                        of the Back End. Her dad works in software development, 
                                        so naturally he is pleased as punch that she's taking 
                                        an interest in his world. Though, he does wish she was 
                                        learning Python. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Mostly, Amanda wants to always keep learning and growing. 
                                        And also to get really really good at coding.
